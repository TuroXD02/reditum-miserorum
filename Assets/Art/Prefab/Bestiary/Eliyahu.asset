  description: Clad in the mantle of the prophet, he falls only to rise again, borne
    aloft by winds unseen. Each return is marked by a sacred gale that clears the
    air around him, scattering all projectiles and granting him brief sanctuary.
    As long as his spirit endures, he shall not remain fallen for long.
